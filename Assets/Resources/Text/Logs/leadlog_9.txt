Everyone went back home. This bug has come to a point where even the government can’t force themselves to come to work. I didn’t feel compelled to go back. There was nothing home I didn’t have here. Plus, I still had deadlines. I work better here.
Problem is, the internet is down. I can only commit my work onto the local network. They shut it down in case of pandemics/emergencies, when hackers would think it best to exploit holes in the security infrastructure.

My code is a mess.

Everything is everywhere. There’s no structure or sense. I need outside help; I need someone to talk me through this. Feel it out. But there’s no rime or reason.
Kayla was good at this stuff. She knew how to talk about code without hurting your self-esteem; which is tough when you look at shit code like mine.

Anyways, I’m the only one here. They kept the facility “open” if you have a super high security level, which I luckily had. Problem is, going out is suicidal. There’s multiple mutations of this damn bug, so you never know if you’ll get the airborne flavor or touch-the-bus-pole flavor.

But where do you get your food?
There’s food in here for 1000s of people. That can last me a good few years.

Aren’t you worried about your family?
Called them, but didn’t answer. Prob busy working.

You’re a fucking idiot
No one asked you.

Do you think I should make an inhouse bathroom module? Don’t want to risk getting the bug.
I think that’s taking it a bit too far. They basically sterilized everything.
