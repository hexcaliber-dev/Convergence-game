This hallway is equipped with several CONVERGENCE INC. Safety Generators (tm) which can restore power in the case of emergencies.

Every generator is equipped with an accessible control panel - here, you may enter the ID number of the device that requires power (see hallway_map.txt for light ID’s; door ID’s are printed on the wall).

By default, Security Lights ensure all intruders are detected and dealt with automatically. To disable them, reroute power to their corresponding ID’s.

When something is caught by Security Lights, power limitations are overriden and all doors in front will go on lock down, no matter their power status at that moment.

All doors behind the Security Light will open up. In order to reset the power distribution to its default, press the security restricted rest button on the control panel.

NOTE: Do not exceed generator power capacity!!!
