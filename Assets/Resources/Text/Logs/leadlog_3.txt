<b>Lead Log #3</b>

	Wow, a third log. Can’t believe I’m still doing this.

It’s Tuesday and Kayla didn’t come. It’s not her fault, there’s this thing going around. Probably just the flu or something. But they told people to stay home. Not for us though, we have government jobs, we have a civil duty to bla la bla. Since Kayla is still in college, and the internship program is technically under her school, the government doesn’t want to jeopardize their publicity with the education community (scared the r/education subreddit gonna write a really angry post).

But I tried calling her (she prefers calls over text, actually, video calls specifically), but she didn’t answer. She always answers. Maybe she’s with that boy she keeps talking about. From what she said, he sounds like a good kid. But still, I wouldn’t be comfortable until I met him.

Anyways, I texted my family if they were ok. They said they were. Of course they were. Their work involved staring at the computer like mine and most people in this country. Eight hours a day looking at a computer. Two hours eating or taking a life tube. <color="green">5</color> hours of consuming some game show or show, maybe text a friend while doing so. One hour for your bathroom module to clean your face up. And eight hours of blissful sleeping…. Idk, it’s kinda funny. It wasn’t always like that.
