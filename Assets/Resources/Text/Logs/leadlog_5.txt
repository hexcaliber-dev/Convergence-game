<b>Lead Log #5</b>

Someone just died. Aurora Arborius. Most people called her Amy.

Nobody knew her though.

It’s only after she sent me a concerning email, after I went to her room to find her scrawled on the floor in fetal position, to find blood, and what I believe to be tears, chaotically yet beautifully surrounding her in a spiraling fashion… did I learn she was in the room next to mine.
 
Kayla hasn’t returned my calls.
