Hello, and thank you for selecting the CONVERGENCE INC. TurtleBot (tm) as your ultimate security solution! We hope you have a wonderful time with it.

QUICK START GUIDE:

By default, the UID of your TurtleBot (tm) will be ‘turtle’. Once you connect to it, you can enter MOVE MODE by entering the command ‘move’.

While in MOVE MODE, press the WASD keys to move around, just like an old school video game! Hit ESC to leave MOVE MODE.

That’s really all you need to know about TurtleBot (tm)! Have fun :D
