<b>Lead Log #4</b>

Not too long ago, people use to go “out” to do things regularly. Like, idk, go ice skating, go for a walk, “shoot some hoops”. I was born near the age that died out. I was <color="green">19</color> when I watched the sidewalk I used to walk on be paved out for more road space or housing. I wasn’t someone who went out much. I was like how most kids are now. In my house, doing my own things in the virtual world. But that sidewalk I took to walk to school everyday… it made me emotional. It surprised me. It was even more surprising and depressing when they bulldozed my elementary school in favor for online schooling. I guess a lot of other things happened that time that made me feel upset, but that stuff really didn’t help. I thought of telling my parents about being upset, but they would have just told me to cope by studying, and I couldn’t really face the notion of telling my friends from the same school. The place, the location, the institution in which we first met was destroyed, and our only form of connection was the online connection that eight billion other people share… I just coded. Pieces of machine instruction ain't going anywhere.

	Anyways, done with rambling, I’m going back to work.
