<b>Lead Log #8</b>

I’ve been here for a few weeks now. Not too different from what I’m used to. I just get to see what it’s like at night. It’s really cold. I’ve slept here before, but the more I sleep here, the colder it gets.

Btw, I think someone is in here with me.

Every time I go in the corridor, I hear footsteps. Every time.

Maybe they added a guard or smth?

Maybe we go to the bathroom at the same time?

Maybe I should talk to him.
Why?

Idk, talking to someone might be nice.

That’s weird.

Kayla didn’t think it was weird. She used to always do it.
Kayla is actually good with people. She was welcoming and understanding.
What do I have that people would want to talk to.
 
Every time I hear the footsteps, they sound closer. Maybe that’s just me.
 
But they’re there.
