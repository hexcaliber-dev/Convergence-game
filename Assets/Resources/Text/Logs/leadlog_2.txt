<b>Lead Log #2</b>

	Ok, this isn’t going to be a normal thing. I just felt compelled to write what happened today. But before I start, the shit I said about Kayla, completely platonic. She is twenty and I’m forty-three. If anything, she’s like a daughter to me. So whatever you were thinking, forget it. I guess she reminded me of someone. 

       	Anyways, nothing much happened. I came back home last night, went to bed, woke up, took the train, did the hundred step verification you have to do when you get to this line of business, and started programming. I’m about to go home. I just wanted to write this. I don’t know why. This is everyday. Except Tuesdays, that’s when we have testing sessions. Kayla is my tester. Usually, testers test via the internet. If there’s something wrong, they ping it, and the coders get annoyed. Coders hate testers, and it will be like that until human extinction. But since Kayla lives near the facility, she always prefers to come over and do the testing on a computer next to me. I like Tuesdays. But today wasn’t Tuesday. It was like any of the other <color="green">6</color> days of the week. The same old.
        	
	So why am I writing this…?
