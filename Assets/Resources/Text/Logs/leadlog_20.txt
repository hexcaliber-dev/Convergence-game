<b>Lead Log #20</b>

We had an interesting conversation today, here:
 
What do you work on?

The AI

What does it actually do tho.

It finds the flaws in humans. What they desire, what they require, what makes the inefficient in some things and sufficient for others. Ya know, all of this for commercial use.

Commercial use?

The government will show it off as R&D shit. America be hella progressive in the field of STEM or whatnot. Show them Russians or smth. But they’re just gonna make it and sell it as a tool for businesses to exploit their customers.

You’re ok with this?

Wdym.

You’re the project lead

I am.

You pitched it?

Yes.

You didn’t pitch it for that? You have different intentions.

Idk.

You never told anyone except for Kayla. I made this AI because I wanted to find the flaws in humans. What made them so damn stupid.

But those flaws are necessarily stupid.

That’s what Kayla said.

You’re just projecting urself onto it,

She said.
