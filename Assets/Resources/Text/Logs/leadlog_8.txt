Automated Bot – Do Not Reply”

“Where the FUCK IS KAYLA”

“This is an Automated Bot – Do Not Reply”
 
So I texted her.
 
“Kayla, where are u. I’m concerned.”
“It says you won’t be my tester.”
 
“Hello”
 
“Kayla! Wtf, you gave me a heart attack”
“My code is messed up, could you at least come over and fix things and talk things over?”

“I’m sorry, you’re mistaken”
 
“Did I do something wrong? I don’t mean to get grumpy you know. Testing bothers everyone, but it’s necessary for any of my code to work!”
 
“Sir, please.”
 
“My code is shit, you know that.”
 
“Stop it, you’re scaring me.”
 
“This is Hayden.”
 
“Very funny Kayla”
“Ok, fine, “Hayden”, how do you like Kayla.”
“Did you hear her laugh, it’s soooo annoying.”
“Oh and did she tell you that time she dropped coffee on my floor and how she had to mop everything with her coat. What a KATASTROPHE”
 
“Sir”
 
“Anyways, “Hayden” when is she coming back?”
 
“Never.”
